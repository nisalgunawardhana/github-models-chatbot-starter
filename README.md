- **Basic Chat Completion**
- **Multi-turn Conversation**
- **Streaming Responses**
- **Image Input Handling**
- **Function/Tool Calling**
- **Reasoning Models** (Complex problem solving and logical reasoning)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system.If you don't have Node.js installed, follow the [official Node.js installation guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for your operating system. You can download the installer for Windows, macOS, or Linux, or use a package manager as described in the documentation.

- A valid GitHub token with access to the inference endpoint.

## Setup

1. Fork the repository by visiting it on GitHub and clicking "Fork" to add it to your account.

2. Clone your forked repository and create a new branch named `submission`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-models-chatbot-starter.git
cd github-models-chatbot-starter
git checkout -b submission
```

3. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the root directory:
```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```
Add your GitHub token to the `.env` file:
```env
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
```
Make sure `.env` is included in `.gitignore`.

4. Install dependencies by running:
```bash
npm install
```
## Running the Examples

The following examples demonstrate how to interact with the GPT-4o model using different features. Each script showcases a specific capability, such as basic chat, multi-turn conversations, streaming responses, image input, function/tool calling, and advanced reasoning(with o1-priview model). Run each file as described to see how the model responds to various types of input and tasks.

### Basic Chat Completion
Run the `sample-basic.js` file:
```bash
node sample-basic.js
```

### Multi-turn Conversation
Run the `sample-multiturn.js` file:
```bash
node sample-multiturn.js
```

### Streaming Responses
Run the `sample-stream.js` file:
```bash
node sample-stream.js
```

### Image Input Handling
Update the `imagePath` in `sample-image.js` to point to your image file, then run:
```bash
node sample-image.js
```

### Function/Tool Calling
Run the `sample-tools.js` file:
```bash
node sample-tools.js
```

### Reasoning Models
Run the `sample-reasoning.js` file to see complex reasoning and problem-solving capabilities:
```bash
node sample-reasoning.js
```

This example demonstrates:
- Mathematical reasoning
- Logic puzzles
- Complex problem solving
- Ethical reasoning scenarios

## Assessment Task: Multi-turn Coding Assistant Chatbot

Showcase your achievement on LinkedIn, GitHub, or your portfolio to impress future employers and peers!

You are required to build a multi-turn chatbot that provides coding assistance using the GPT-4o model via GitHub's AI inference API. Your chatbot should maintain conversation context, offer meaningful programming help, and support multiple languages and coding scenarios.

### What to Do

1. **Environment Setup**
  - Use the `dotenv` package to load environment variables.
  - Add your GitHub token to a `.env` file as `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
  - Ensure your `.env` is listed in `.gitignore`.

2. **API Initialization**
  - Use the `openai` npm package.
  - Configure the API client to use your GitHub token and the GitHub models endpoint.

3. **Conversation Logic**
  - Implement a loop that lets the user and bot exchange messages.
  - Store the conversation history so the chatbot remembers previous messages.
  - Allow the user to exit the chat gracefully (e.g., by typing `exit`).

4. **Coding Assistance Features**
  - Respond to user questions about programming concepts, code examples, debugging, and best practices.
  - Support multiple programming languages.
  - Provide clear, helpful, and accurate responses.

5. **Error Handling**
  - Handle API errors and invalid inputs gracefully.

### Example

- User: "How do I create a function in JavaScript?"
- Bot: "You can use the `function` keyword or an arrow function. For example: `function greet() { console.log('Hello'); }`"

- User: "Can you help me debug this code?"
- Bot: "Sure! Please share your code and describe the issue."

### Where to Implement

- Write your solution in the `assessment.js` file in this repository.

**Complete the assessment as described below to earn your certificate and badge!**

Once you have finished implementing your multi-turn coding assistant chatbot in `assessment.js` and submitted your pull request, you will be eligible to receive an official certificate and badge from MLSA.
